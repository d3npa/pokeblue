I wanted to play Pokemon Blue as Green instead of Red. I've adapted [Hatun's Blue sprites](https://www.deviantart.com/ghost-missingno/art/Blue-Sprites-for-R-G-B-Y-339796334) using GIMP. As I play through I may modify some of the text to fix some discontinuity, since the original script was not written with a female player in mind.
